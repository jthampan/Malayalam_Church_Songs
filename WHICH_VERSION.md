## 🎯 Most Common Scenarios

### "I need to generate a PPT right now, I'm at the church office"
→ Use **Google Colab** (open link, upload files, done)

### "I generate PPTs every week from my home computer"
→ Use **Windows .exe** (one-time setup, then super fast every week)

### "I'm traveling but need to create a presentation"
→ Use **Google Colab** (works from anywhere with internet)

### "I don't have internet at home"
→ Use **Windows .exe** (completely offline after first setup)

→ Use **Google Colab** (just share the link - no installation for anyone)

## ❓ Still Not Sure?

**Try Google Colab first!** It requires no installation and you can test it immediately. If you find yourself using it weekly and want faster performance, then download the Windows .exe.

**Both versions produce identical PowerPoint files!** Choose based on convenience, not quality.
